              While taking Myfembree, your estrogen levels may be low. Low estrogen levels can lead to BMD loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have bone loss on Myfembree, your BMD may improve after you stop taking Myfembree,
              but complete recovery may not occur. It is unknown if these BMD changes could increase
              your risk for broken bones as you age. For this reason, you should not take Myfembree for
              more than 24 months.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your healthcare provider may order an X-ray test called a DXA scan to check your bone mineral
              density when you start taking Myfembree and periodically after you start.

              Do not take Myfembree if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, as it may increase the
              risk of early pregnancy loss.
            </li>

              If you think you may be pregnant, stop taking Myfembree right away and call your HCP.

            <li>
              Myfembree can decrease your menstrual bleeding or result in no menstrual bleeding at all,
              making it hard to know if you are pregnant. Watch for other pregnancy signs like breast
              tenderness, weight gain, and nausea.
            </li>
            <li>
              Myfembree does not prevent pregnancy. You will need to use effective methods of birth control
              while taking Myfembree and for 1 week after you stop taking Myfembree. Examples of effective
              methods can include condoms or spermicide, which do not contain hormones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Talk to your HCP about which birth control to use during treatment with Myfembree. Your
              HCP may change the birth control you are on before you start taking Myfembree.
